# PWR
## Personal Workout Regimen

## Introduction
For a group project, two other developers and I built PWR. I worked on most of the front-end React work, while also assisting with setting up the database in Express.js. PWR is a React app that allows users to choose a workout category from three choices. Then a list of about 5-10 workouts render and the user is able to choose as many as she/he wants to save on their personal workout regimen section. Within the 10 workouts that render, users are able to edit the workout details and/or create a new one.
